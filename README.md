# ons_deaths_data

Some processing and graphing scripts for [ONS Death](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales) data.

The code extracts the relevant data, homogenises it and graphs.

Very much work in progress.
